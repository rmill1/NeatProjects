# Neat Projects I've Built!

Ranging from silly and fun to actually quite useful in varioius roles I've had, this is a collection of neat projects I've built:

## The Projects

1. Flask Mascot Quiz - find your weird Minor League Baseball mascot aesthetic
2. Masterpiece Scoring Calculator - I built this during the 2023-2024 FLL Robotics season when the official calculator wasn't working
3. Bootstrap Styling - I wanted to make a point to some students I was teaching that you can actually do A LOT with Bootstrap styling
4. Seating Chart Generator - built and used this in my CompSci classes! Very handy dandy
