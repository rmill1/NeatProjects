# Neat Projects I've Built!

Ranging from silly and fun to actually quite useful in the varioius roles I've had, this is a collection of neat projects I've built:

## The Projects

1. Masterpiece Scoring Calculator - I built this during the 2023-2024 FLL Robotics season when the official calculator wasn't working
2. Bootstrap Styling - I wanted to make a point to some students I was teaching that you can actually do A LOT with Bootstrap styling
3. Seating Chart Generator - built and used this in my CompSci classes! Very handy dandy
4. JavaScript Pokedex - I like Pokemon. Look up any Pokemon and get some fast facts about it! Uses the PokeApi
5. Pokemon Flavor Text Quiz - a Python quiz that tests your knowledge of Pokemon flavor text (the descriptive text found on the Pokemon trading cards)
6. Fancy Seating Chart Generator - click your own seating chart given the number of students in the class and the arrangement of desks on a given day
